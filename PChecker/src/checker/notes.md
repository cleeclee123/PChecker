will http proxies always have a web rtc leak?

The HTTP proxy itself does not inherently cause WebRTC leaks. WebRTC leaks occur when the browser is able to bypass the proxy and use the real IP address instead. This usually happens because of the way WebRTC is designed.

WebRTC is a peer-to-peer protocol, meaning it is designed to communicate directly between browsers, without going through a server. This is why it often bypasses proxies and VPNs - it's trying to establish a direct connection.

However, not all HTTP proxies will have a WebRTC leak. It depends on various factors such as:

Browser settings: In some cases, you can disable WebRTC or change its settings to prevent it from leaking the real IP address. For example, in Firefox you can set media.peerconnection.enabled to false in about:config to disable WebRTC.

Proxy settings: Some proxies or VPNs have options to prevent WebRTC leaks. For example, some VPNs have a "kill switch" feature that will cut off all internet access if the VPN disconnects, preventing leaks.

Website code: The website you're visiting needs to actually use WebRTC for a leak to occur. If the website doesn't use WebRTC, there won't be a leak.

So, while it's possible for a WebRTC leak to occur when using an HTTP proxy, it's not a guaranteed outcome. It's best to test for leaks using a tool like the Puppeteer script in the previous responses to know for sure.


how does the stun server know my real ip address if i am using an http proxy

When you're using WebRTC, the STUN server is used to discover your public IP address and the type of NAT you're behind. This is part of the ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment) process, which is a framework to allow your web browser to connect with peers.

The reason STUN servers can find your real IP address, even when you're using a proxy or VPN, is because the STUN/ICE requests are not made over the HTTP/HTTPS protocol, but over UDP or TCP protocol directly from your device. Proxies typically only handle HTTP or HTTPS traffic, so the direct UDP or TCP requests from your device to the STUN server bypass the proxy and reveal your real IP address. This is what's referred to as a WebRTC leak.

The STUN server sends a request to the device and then inspects the response. The response includes the IP address and port from which the response was received, which allows the STUN server to determine the device's public IP address.

To prevent STUN servers from finding your real IP address, you would need to use a proxy or VPN solution that also routes non-HTTP/HTTPS traffic or use a browser or browser settings that disable or limit WebRTC. For instance, in Firefox, you can disable WebRTC completely or use the 'media.peerconnection.ice.default_address_only' setting to limit IP address exposure.
